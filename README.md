# Go TCP Client

Multi-client TCP echo-server client.

## Usage

- Clone this repo and my `go-tcp-server` one.
    - Follow first the instructions of the server respository.

- Connect a new client to the server by running `go run main.go`.
    - By default you connect to `localhost` in port `8080`. You may change it if you wish, but remember to change it on `go-tcp-server` as well. 

- Type your username as prompted, and you may start sending messages!

- You can then connect as many clients as you want!

- Type "END" to close the client connection to the server.
